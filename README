Math-Random-MT-Perl version 1.10
================================

Pure Perl implementation of the Mersenne Twister algorithm as implemented in
C/XS in Math::Random::MT. The Mersenne Twister is a 32 bit pseudorandom number
generator developed by Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura. It is
characterised by a very uniform distribution but is not cryptographically
secure.

The interface is the same as that of Math::Random::MT. The output is identical
to the C/XS version. The tests are straight out of Math::Random::MT and they
all pass. A script in /t called validate.pl tests the output of this module
against the C version. No differences in output were detected in 10e8 trials
with a single seed or 10e8 trials with 1000 random seeds.

The only good reason to use this module is if you can't install Math::Random::MT,
need to use threads or you want code to cut and paste into a project.

SPEED

Runs around 1/3-1/2 as fast as Math::Random::MT, however that still means a
Benchmark random number generation speed of 100,000/sec on modest hardware,
so this is unlikely to cause a significant bottleneck in most circumstances.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Instead of make, use dmake or nmake on Win32.

DEPENDENCIES

None
